          <p><strong> Towards Regulated Security and Privacy in Emerging Computing Platforms</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;">
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>  
          <p>Computing is undergoing a significant shift. First, the explosive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) enables users to interact with computing systems and physical environments in novel ways through perceptual interfaces. Second, machine learning algorithms collect vast amounts of data and make critical decisions on new computing systems. While these trends bring unprecedented functionality, they also drastically increase the number of untrusted algorithms, implementations, interfaces, and the amount of private data they process, endangering user security and privacy. To regulate these security and privacy issues, regulations such as GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) went into effect. However, a massive gap exists between the desired high-level security/privacy/ethical properties (from regulations, specifications, and users’ expectations) and low-level real implementations. 
            To bridge the gap, my work aims to 1) change how platform architects design secure systems, 2) assist developers by detecting security and privacy violations of implementations, and 3) build usable and scalable privacy-preserving systems. In this talk, I will present how my group designs principled solutions to ensure the security and privacy of emerging computing platforms. I will introduce two developer tools we build to detect security and privacy violations with machine-learning-augmented analysis. Using the tools, we found large numbers of GDPR violations in web plugins and security property violations in IoT messaging protocol implementations. Additionally, I will discuss our recent work on scalable privacy-preserving machine learning, the first privacy-preserving machine learning framework for modern machine learning models and data with all operations on GPUs.

            Language Models: Personalized 
            Privacy and Pretrained Models</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;">
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>  
          <p>As artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) increasingly influence every facet of our lives, ensuring the privacy of user data has become paramount. In this talk, I will review the common privacy attacks for extracting training data from a trained model and common defenses for training privacy-enhanced machine learning models using privacy sensitive data. I will then present our recent works and discuss open challenges related to two directions: 1) ensuring user-centered and personalized privacy for building privacy-enhanced models, and 2) new privacy attacks and defenses given the emerging fine-tuning paradigm using pre-trained LLMs.</p>

          <p><strong>Certifying Trustworthy Machine Learning: From Defenses to Attacks</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;">
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>  
          <p>In the past decade, adversarial attacks and defenses have been extensively studied to expose vulnerabilities and develop countermeasures for enhancing the robustness of machine learning models. This talk will present our recent advances in certifying both defenses and attacks, with a focus on moving from empirical approaches to provable guarantees. First, we will introduce Text-CRS, the first generalized certified robustness framework for language models against a wide range of word-level adversarial operations, including synonym substitution, word reordering, insertion, and deletion. By leveraging randomized smoothing in both permutation and embedding spaces, Text-CRS improves certified accuracy and robustness. Second, we will shift focus to the attack side by introducing certifiable black-box adversarial attacks. While certified defenses have been well studied, this is the first attack framework that provides provable guarantees for the attack success probability (ASP). It reveals critical weaknesses in machine learning models, even those protected by state-of-the-art defenses. Our attack framework constructs a continuous space of adversarial examples with lower-bounded (high) ASP. Finally, we will discuss the certification in other areas of trustworthy machine learning.   </p>

          <p><strong>Building Efficient, Scalable, and Heterogeneous Federated Learning Systems</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;">
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>  
          <p> Data privacy has become a critical concern in modern AI systems. As a remedy to this concern, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm where clients distributed at different geographical locations can collaboratively train an AI model while keeping their own data locally. While theoretical studies in federated learning have made significant progress, we are still confronted with challenges on building practical federated learning systems. 
            In this talk, I will share our experiences in building efficient, scalable, and heterogeneous federated learning systems. First, I will present our work on developing an importance-sampling based FL framework that significantly enhances the training efficiency under the limited wireless network bandwidth without compromising the training quality. Second, I will focus on the client selection component of the FL pipeline and talk about our work on developing a data and system heterogeneity-aware client selection scheme that jointly enhances the efficiency and scalability of FL systems. Third, we present a simple yet powerful framework that enables model-heterogeneous FL, where models with different capacities can be trained on end systems with heterogeneous resources. This work lays the foundation for developing FL systems for training large-scale AI models such as large language models and foundation models in general. I will conclude the talk by briefly introducing our recent initiative on FedAIoT whose vision is to extend FL to much richer data modalities and compute devices encountered in the real world.

          <p><strong>Secure Content Moderation for Generative AI</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;">
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>  
          <p>Generative AI–such as GPT-4 and DALL-E 3–raises many ethical and legal concerns such as the generation of harmful content, scaling disinformation and misinformation campaigns, as well as disrupting education and learning. Content moderation for generative AI aims to address these ethical and legal concerns via 1) preventing a generative AI model from synthesizing harmful content, and 2) detecting AI-generated content. Prevention is often implemented using safety filters, while detection is implemented by watermark. Both prevention and watermark-based detection have been recently widely deployed by industry. In this talk, we will discuss the security of existing prevention and watermark-based detection methods in adversarial settings.</p>

            <p><strong>Defending and Defeating AI: Protecting the Good, Attacking the Bad for Privacy, Security and Fairness</strong></p>
          </div>
  
          <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto; text-align: justify;">
            <p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p>  
            <p>AI models are increasingly being deployed for a wide range of critical tasks, from healthcare diagnosis to autonomous driving. However, recent research has revealed that these models are vulnerable to various attacks, including data poisoning and test-time evasion, which can severely compromise their effectiveness. In this talk, we will begin by exploring some of our current work aimed at enhancing the robustness of AI models by reducing the transferability of attacks and developing novel defense techniques in the context of Federated Learning. Additionally, we will discuss how blockchain-based incentive mechanisms can be employed to further mitigate potential attacks by fostering a more secure environment for AI deployment. Finally, we will discuss whether explainable AI based approaches could be used to rectify some of the AI errors. In the second part of the talk, we will shift focus to the offensive side, presenting our work on attacking AI models that may violate privacy or fairness. These proactive attacks are designed to expose and rectify flaws in AI systems, ensuring they are used in a way that protects individual privacy and promotes fairness.</p>
